Comparison of pros and cons of the modeling techniques used:

I employed various modelling techniques to pre-process the data. One of the advantages of dropping the rows with missing values in the target variable column (interest rate) is that it does not significantly impact the size of the dataset, but the downside is that resulting dataset may have selection bias. I created new features to help in building a more accurate model by capturing the impact of some variables on interest rates. However, one disadvantage of creating dummy variables is that it may lead to multicollinearity. I tried using Linear regression to predict missing values in a column, which may not be accurate if there is no correlation between the missing value column and other variables. I used Spearman correlation and linear regression R-squared for analyzing relationships between X and y variables. Spearman correlation can capture non-linear relationships and does not require assumptions of normality or linearity but it may miss complex relationships. Whereas a linear regression assumes a linear relationship and can be affected by outliers.Based on the performance metrics, it appeared to me that Gradient Boosting is the best model for this dataset. It has the lowest Test RMSE, which indicates that it has the best predictive power among the models evaluated. Additionally, the Train RMSE is higher than the Test RMSE, which suggests that the model is not overfitting the training data. Random Forest also performs well, with a Test RMSE that is only slightly higher than Gradient Boosting. However, it has a higher Train RMSE than Gradient Boosting, indicating that it may be overfitting the training data. While Decision Tree has the lowest Train RMSE, its Test RMSE is the highest among the models, indicating that it has the worst predictive power. Finally, Linear Regression performs similarly to Gradient Boosting, but its performance is not as good as it has higher Test and Train RMSE. Overall, Gradient Boosting appears to be the best model for this dataset, as it has the best predictive power and is less likely to overfit the data.
